# 🔥 Blame Time!!!
**Current Status:** [ PANIC ]

## What is this?
This is a minimalist Incident Response Dashboard built for speed, not bureaucracy. 
It answers the three most important questions in IT:
1. Is it broken?
2. How bad is it?
3. Who touched it last?

## Philosophy
* **No JIRA Tickets:** We don't need a ticket number to know the server is on fire.
* **No Luxury UI:** If you have time to nitpicking, it's not a crisis.
* **Frontend Only:** Because the backend is probably what's down anyway.

## Tech Stack
* **React:** For the UI.
* **LocalStorage:** Because we trust the browser more than the database right now.
* **Panic:** The driving force behind this architecture.

*"Move fast and break things, then use this tool to track what you broke."*
